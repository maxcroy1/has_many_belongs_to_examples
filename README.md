For this assignment, we were tasked with coming up with an example of real world Two Model Belongs To/Has Many relationship. 

For my example, I decided to model the relationship that a Collector has with their records. A Collector can have a massive record collection, but a record can only have one owner. 

In this example, a record can be instantiated with a name, an aritst, and an owner. An owner is just instantiated with a name. 

The owner is able to see a list of all of their records, find records by a particular artist, and find a specific record.
